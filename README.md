Claude UI is something a little odd: it is an astro web app with react which makes calls to claude code (for now) via an API wrapper. The actual app is... idk, let's use assistant-ui for a chat threaded view, but we're also wanting to see this operate a little differently as well. There should be an initiative for a more custom / innoviate ui than just a chat thread. I'm especially thinking of visual and file tree struc based development.

At the base level I think what I'm after is codifying a personal type system for a project, meaning to design a UI which enables a typing for Claude Code to use as a design, plan, implementation, test, reviewing system. The UI should be a crystal clear, compact, even printable representation of development work achieved using Claude Code. It should accept multiple different UI/UX paradigms including conventioanl threading (which we'll go ahead and write an adaptation schema between Claude Code and asssitant-ui) -- the idea is to let this be an electron based desktop app at some some point for but for now we'll just develop on Chromium.
