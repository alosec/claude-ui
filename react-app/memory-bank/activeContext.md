# Active Context: React-Astro Integration RESOLVED ✅

## Current Status
**SUCCESS**: React app components fully integrated into Astro and hydrating correctly!

## What Was Fixed
The hydration errors were caused by Astro's module resolution not properly handling TypeScript type imports from external files. The solution was to define types inline within each component file instead of importing from a shared types file.

## What We've Done
✅ Migrated all React components to Astro app src/  
✅ Removed conflicting ThemeToggle.astro component  
✅ Updated Layout.astro to remove ThemeToggle references  
✅ **FIXED**: Defined types inline in each component to bypass import issues  
✅ **FIXED**: Updated Astro page to import App.tsx with proper extension  
✅ Cleared Astro cache and restarted dev server  

## What's Now Working
✅ React components hydrate successfully in browser  
✅ Theme toggle functionality works  
✅ React Router navigation functional  
✅ Projects table displays data correctly  
✅ File tree component renders properly  

## Solution Summary
**Root Cause**: Astro's client-side hydration couldn't resolve TypeScript type imports from shared files  
**Fix**: Moved type definitions inline within each component file  
**Result**: All React functionality preserved within Astro framework

## Environment
- Astro dev server: http://localhost:8082/ (fully functional)
- React dev server: http://localhost:8081/ (reference implementation)
- Both servers running simultaneously for comparison

## Next Steps
Migration complete. Ready for further development or testing.
