# Project Brief: React-to-Astro Migration

## Core Requirements
Migrate the advanced React application to run within Astro framework while maintaining:
- Electron desktop app capability
- React Router navigation
- Theme switching functionality  
- File tree browsing interface
- Project management features

## Primary Goal
Replace Astro app's src/ directory entirely with React app components, using Astro as a wrapper framework for dual web/Electron deployment capability.

## Key Constraints
- Preserve Astro configuration for Electron compatibility
- Maintain neobrutalist black/white design system
- Keep React components' modular architecture
- Ensure SSR/SSG benefits from Astro framework

## Success Criteria
- React app renders correctly within Astro
- Theme toggle works seamlessly
- Navigation between projects functions
- Electron build process remains intact
- Tests pass with updated components
