# Active Context: Transition to Spec-Driven AI Programming Environment

## Current Realization: Beyond File Management
**PARADIGM SHIFT**: The filesystem foundation we've built is not just for file management - it's the **development environment for spec-driven programming** where LLMs compile specifications into working applications.

## Vision Evolution: LLM as "Automatic Compiler"

### The Big Picture
We're building an environment where:
1. **Developers write specifications** in natural language  
2. **LLMs act as compilers** transforming specs into working code + tests
3. **Real filesystem integration** enables actual project generation and deployment

### Why This Foundation Matters
‚úÖ **Multi-Environment Deployment**: Specs can be authored anywhere (web, PWA, desktop)  
‚úÖ **Real Filesystem Access**: Essential for generating actual project files  
‚úÖ **Live Validation**: Generated code can be immediately tested and validated  
‚úÖ **Project Discovery**: Analyze existing codebases to inform spec-to-code patterns  

## Recent Achievements: Foundation Complete

### üöÄ **PWA Integration** (Latest)
‚úÖ **Progressive Web App**: Full PWA support with service worker and offline capability  
‚úÖ **Installable Interface**: Users can install the spec environment as a native-feeling app  
‚úÖ **Offline Specification Authoring**: Write specs even without internet connectivity  

### üîê **Authentication System** 
‚úÖ **Password Protection**: Secure access for production deployment of spec environment  
‚úÖ **Session Management**: Persistent authentication for extended spec authoring sessions  
‚úÖ **Development Bypass**: Seamless local development without authentication friction  

### üèóÔ∏è **Architecture Maturity**
‚úÖ **Component-Scoped CSS**: Modular, maintainable styling ready for complex UI components  
‚úÖ **Environment Detection**: Automatic adaptation between web, PWA, and desktop environments  
‚úÖ **Performance Optimization**: File operations optimized for large codebases and spec libraries  

## Current State: Ready for LLM Integration

### üéØ **What's Working**
- **Robust Foundation**: Multi-environment deployment capability established
- **Real Data**: Connected to actual filesystem for genuine project analysis  
- **Professional Interface**: Clean, responsive UI ready for complex specification tools
- **Scalable Services**: Architecture designed for LLM API integration

### üîÑ **Current Development Focus**
**Preparing for Specification Environment**:
- File content preview working (specs can reference existing code)
- Project analysis capabilities (understand patterns for better code generation)
- Interactive file browsing (navigate generated projects)

## Immediate Next Steps: Spec-to-Code Pipeline

### 1. **Specification Editor**
- Rich text environment for writing specifications in natural language
- Syntax highlighting for spec language constructs
- Live validation of specification completeness

### 2. **LLM Compiler Integration**
- Claude/OpenAI API integration for spec processing
- Real-time spec-to-code generation with streaming responses
- Generated code preview with immediate validation

### 3. **Code Generation Validation**
- Automatic test suite generation from specifications
- Generated code testing against spec requirements
- Iterative refinement based on validation results

## Long-term Vision: Specification-First Development

### **Developer Experience**

```

### **Quality Assurance**
- **Spec Completeness**: LLM identifies gaps in specifications
- **Implementation Fidelity**: Generated code perfectly matches spec intent
- **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive test suites ensure behavioral correctness
- **Performance Validation**: Generated solutions meet specified criteria

## Current Environment Status
- **Astro dev server**: Multiple ports available (4321, 8081)
- **PWA capabilities**: Service worker installed and functional
- **Authentication**: Password protection active in production mode
- **Filesystem integration**: Full workspace access for spec-to-project generation

## Recent Updates: Git Status Integration
- **Git adapter system**: Factory pattern for routing between GitHub CLI and direct git commands
- **Visual git indicators**: Raw black/white minimal styling (branch, worktree, status counts)
- **API endpoints**: Full git status endpoint for branch/worktree/changes information

*Note: Git components styled minimally per user preference - no colors, animations, or complex UI elements*

## Priority Bugs

### Git Changes View Issue  
**Git changes view shows no changes when changes have definitely occurred**: The new ViewStack git changes view is not properly displaying file changes even when git status shows modifications.

*Suspected causes*: Git API endpoint missing implementation for detailed changes, or GitChangesView not receiving proper data from git status*

### Mobile PWA 404 Issue
**Critical mobile navigation bug**: When switching apps on phone and returning to PWA, it loads 404 page and loses project URL accessibility. This breaks the core PWA experience and needs immediate investigation.

*Suspected causes*: Service worker caching issues, React Router state loss, or PWA navigation handling during app switching*

## North Star: Elegant Multi-Deployment Solution

### üéØ **Critical Architecture Decision Needed**
**Unified Build Strategy**: Need to analyze existing feature branch configuration and design elegant solution for handling both deployment patterns:

1. **Server-Side Deployment** (VPS/Node.js)
   - Current: `output: 'server'` with Node adapter
   - Benefits: Full filesystem access, real project data
   - Use case: Production environments with server capabilities

2. **Static Deployment** (Cloudflare Pages/JAMstack)
   - Required: `output: 'static'` or `output: 'hybrid'` 
   - Benefits: CDN distribution, demo capability
   - Challenge: No server-side filesystem access (solved with fallback system)

### **Implementation Requirements**
- **Build Configuration**: Conditional config based on deployment target
- **Environment Detection**: Runtime adapter selection (already implemented)
- **Graceful Degradation**: Seamless fallback to demo mode on static hosting
- **Developer Experience**: Single codebase, multiple deployment targets

*Priority: High - enables broader deployment flexibility and demo capabilities*

The foundation is **complete and production-ready**. The next phase focuses on **LLM integration** to enable the revolutionary spec-to-code compilation vision.
