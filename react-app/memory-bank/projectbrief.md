# Project Brief: Spec-Driven AI Programming Environment

## Core Vision
Build a development environment where **Large Language Models function as "automatic compilers"** - transforming human-readable specifications directly into working applications and comprehensive test suites.

## Revolutionary Paradigm Shift
**Traditional**: Manual coding from ambiguous specifications  
**AI-Driven**: Specifications automatically compile to working apps + tests

## Primary Requirements
- **Multi-Environment Deployment**: Web, PWA, Electron desktop app
- **Real Filesystem Integration**: Connect to actual developer workspaces
- **Specification Authoring Environment**: Natural language spec writing
- **LLM Compiler Integration**: Automatic spec-to-code generation
- **Live Validation**: Real-time verification of generated code against specs

## Architecture Foundation âœ… COMPLETE
- **Astro + React**: Multi-environment wrapper with React components
- **Filesystem Services**: Real project discovery and file operations
- **Component Architecture**: Modular, scalable UI components
- **Authentication**: Secure access for production deployment
- **PWA Support**: Installable app with offline capabilities

## Next Phase: LLM Integration
- **Spec Editor**: Rich environment for specification authoring
- **Code Generation**: Real-time spec-to-code compilation
- **Test Suite Generation**: Automatic test creation from specifications
- **Validation Pipeline**: Ensure generated code meets spec requirements

## Success Criteria
- Natural language specifications compile to working applications
- Generated code passes comprehensive test suites
- Iterative spec refinement through LLM feedback
- Production-ready code generation from specifications
