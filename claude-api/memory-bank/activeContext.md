# Claude API - Active Context

## Current Project Status
**Status**: Implementation Complete - Ready for Testing Phase
**Date**: January 2025
**Phase**: Testing and Evaluation

## Recently Completed Work

### Core Implementation (100% Complete)
✅ **API Server Foundation**
- Express.js server with comprehensive middleware stack
- Security headers, CORS, rate limiting, compression
- Structured logging with Winston
- Environment-based configuration
- Health check endpoints

✅ **Service Layer Architecture**  
- `jq-processor.js` - Query validation, execution, caching
- `claude-cli.js` - CLI wrapper with process management
- `session-store.js` - File system data access layer
- `file-helpers.js` - Utility functions for safe operations
- `streaming.js` - NDJSON middleware and transform streams

✅ **RESTful API Endpoints**
- `/api/v1/sessions` - Full CRUD operations on Claude sessions
- `/api/v1/projects` - Project management and statistics
- `/api/v1/chat` - Real-time streaming chat interface  
- `/api/v1/query` - Advanced jq query processing

✅ **Streaming Infrastructure**
- Real-time NDJSON streaming for chat responses
- Backpressure handling and connection management
- Transform streams for data pipeline processing
- Error recovery and timeout handling

✅ **Testing Framework**
- Unit tests for all service components
- Integration tests for full API workflows  
- Mock implementations for external dependencies
- Test fixtures and sample data

## Active Development Focus

### Current Priority: Testing and Validation
Our immediate focus is comprehensive testing and evaluation of the implemented system:

1. **Unit Test Execution**
   - Validate jq processor security and functionality
   - Test Claude CLI wrapper with mock processes
   - Verify session store data access patterns
   - Check file helpers utility functions

2. **Integration Test Suite**
   - Full API workflow testing
   - End-to-end session management
   - Streaming chat functionality validation
   - Error handling and edge case coverage

3. **Performance Evaluation**
   - Load testing with realistic data volumes
   - Memory usage profiling under concurrent load
   - jq query performance benchmarking
   - Streaming response latency measurement

## Technical Implementation Details

### Architecture Decisions Made
- **Service-Oriented Design**: Clean separation between routes, services, and data access
- **Streaming-First Approach**: NDJSON for real-time chat and large dataset processing
- **Security-by-Design**: Input validation, query sanitization, path traversal protection
- **Error Resilience**: Comprehensive error handling with graceful degradation

### Key Features Delivered
- **jq Integration**: Native jq processing with security validation and query caching
- **Claude CLI Wrapper**: Full process management with timeout and resource limits
- **Session Management**: CRUD operations with filtering, pagination, and search
- **Real-time Chat**: Streaming conversations with session resumption support

### Data Flow Patterns
1. **Request → Validation → Service → Processing → Response**
2. **File System → Stream Processing → jq Query → Result Aggregation**
3. **Chat Request → CLI Spawn → Stream Management → NDJSON Response**

## Configuration and Environment

### Development Environment Setup
- Node.js 18+ with ES module support
- Claude CLI installed and authenticated
- Access to `~/.claude/projects/` directory
- Port 3000 available for API server

### Key Environment Variables
```bash
CLAUDE_PROJECTS_PATH=/home/user/.claude/projects
PORT=3000
LOG_LEVEL=info
RATE_LIMIT=1000
```

### Dependencies Status
- **Production Dependencies**: 9 packages (express, node-jq, winston, joi, etc.)
- **Development Dependencies**: 7 packages (jest, supertest, eslint, etc.)
- **External Requirements**: Claude CLI availability verified

## Next Immediate Steps

### 1. Test Execution (High Priority)
- Run unit test suite: `npm test`
- Execute integration tests: `npm run test:integration`  
- Generate coverage report: `npm run test:coverage`
- Validate all test scenarios pass

### 2. Functional Validation
- Start development server: `npm run dev`
- Test health endpoint: `curl http://localhost:3000/health`
- Verify Claude projects path detection
- Test basic session enumeration

### 3. Performance Evaluation
- Load test with realistic session data
- Measure jq query performance on large datasets
- Test streaming chat with concurrent connections
- Monitor memory usage under load

### 4. Security Assessment
- Validate jq query sanitization effectiveness
- Test path traversal protection
- Verify rate limiting enforcement
- Check error message sanitization

## Known Considerations

### Testing Requirements
- **Mock Claude CLI**: Tests use mocked child processes for Claude CLI operations
- **Temporary File System**: Integration tests create isolated test environments
- **Async Operations**: Comprehensive async/await error handling validation

### Production Readiness Checklist
- [ ] Unit tests pass (0/3 test suites executed)
- [ ] Integration tests pass (0/1 test suite executed)  
- [ ] Performance meets specifications (< 100ms simple queries)
- [ ] Security validation complete (jq sanitization, path protection)
- [ ] Memory usage within limits (< 512MB base)
- [ ] Error handling comprehensive (all edge cases covered)

### Future Enhancement Opportunities
- WebSocket support for persistent connections
- Authentication and authorization layer
- Redis caching for improved performance
- Monitoring dashboard and metrics collection
- CLI companion tool for API interaction

## Development Notes

### Code Quality Standards Met
- ES6+ modules with comprehensive JSDoc documentation
- Structured error handling with contextual logging
- Input validation using Joi schemas
- Security-first design with defense in depth

### Architecture Benefits Achieved
- **Scalability**: Stateless design enables horizontal scaling
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns and modular structure
- **Extensibility**: Plugin architecture for custom functionality
- **Reliability**: Comprehensive error handling and resource management

**Next Action Required**: Execute test suites to validate implementation and identify any issues before moving to production deployment phase.
